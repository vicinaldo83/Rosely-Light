# Rosely-Light
The Rosely Light Discord Theme is based on a millennial pink-inspired color palette.

I first discovered Rosely through their theme in VSCode. I really like their color palette and have been using it for everything on my computer, so I decided to create a theme based on their design for Discord too. If you want to know more, you can visit their [website](https://rosely.hellotham.com/).

This is my first time working with themes, so I used [Wildberry](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Wildberry) as a base. It may contain some errors or unusual code.
